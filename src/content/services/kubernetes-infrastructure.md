## Service Overview

Specialized Kubernetes infrastructure services for organizations looking to containerize their applications and run them reliably at scale. From initial cluster setup to ongoing management and optimization, I provide end-to-end Kubernetes expertise.

## Key Offerings

### Cluster Design & Implementation

- **Cluster Architecture**: Design secure, multi-zone Kubernetes clusters
- **Managed vs Self-hosted**: Guidance on choosing between EKS/GKE or self-managed solutions
- **Networking Setup**: Configure CNI, ingress controllers, and service meshes
- **Storage Solutions**: Implement persistent storage with appropriate storage classes

### Automation & GitOps

- **Helm Chart Development**: Create reusable Helm charts for application deployment
- **GitOps with ArgoCD**: Implement GitOps workflows for declarative infrastructure
- **CI/CD Integration**: Connect Kubernetes with existing CI/CD pipelines
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage Kubernetes resources with Terraform or Crossplane

### Operations & Reliability

- **Monitoring Stack**: Set up Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for comprehensive observability
- **Auto-scaling**: Configure HPA, VPA, and cluster auto-scaler for optimal resource usage
- **Security Hardening**: Implement network policies, pod security, and RBAC
- **Backup & DR**: Set up Velero for cluster backup and disaster recovery

### Performance Optimization

- **Resource Management**: Right-size requests/limits and implement quality of service
- **Cost Optimization**: Identify and eliminate resource waste
- **Scaling Strategies**: Design horizontal and vertical scaling approaches
- **Troubleshooting**: Performance debugging and optimization
