# About David Essien

#### DevOps & Full-Stack Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure | CI/CD | AWS & Kubernetes

---

I didn’t start out thinking I’d build a career in tech. What drew me in was simpler than coding or servers: the idea that computers could help people **learn and share knowledge**, even when school wasn’t an option. That curiosity grew into a passion for **software and infrastructure**, and a drive to build systems that actually work for real people.

Today, I help teams and companies keep their applications and services running smoothly. I focus on **cloud architecture, automation, and reliability**, using tools like AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines. Whether it’s backend systems, applications, or infrastructure, my goal is always the same: **make it stable, secure, and fast so teams can do their best work**.

Over the past 4+ years, I’ve worked with global teams and clients across startups and growing companies. Some highlights include:

- Setting up **Kubernetes clusters with Terraform**, building automated CI/CD pipelines, and implementing monitoring for high uptime and cost efficiency.
- Managing **multi-cloud environments** with AWS and GCP, streamlining deployments, and keeping services reliable under pressure.
- Designing **secure cloud architectures** and fullstack monitoring systems that solve real-world problems.

What I enjoy most is **learning, problem-solving, and building systems that last**. When something breaks, I approach it methodically: I communicate with the people affected, understand the working system, analyze what went wrong, learn or ask for knowledge if needed, fix it, and then implement steps to prevent it from happening again. I document everything so teams grow stronger with each challenge.

Clients and colleagues appreciate my **ownership, resilience, and commitment to delivering value**. I don’t stop at what’s expected; I aim to make systems better, faster, and more reliable, while protecting integrity and trust.

I love working with: startups, small teams, growing companies, founders, and non-technical teams — **anyone who needs dependable infrastructure and a partner they can trust**. I’m open to remote, local, global, or relocation-based roles.

Outside of work, family keeps me grounded. I spend time with my wife and children, study the Bible, mentor young people, and speak on technology and life. I enjoy movies, helping others design meaningful lives, and guiding people and teams toward clarity and growth.

I’m **curious, practical, direct, and thoughtful**, and I care about building things that last — systems, teams, and trust.
